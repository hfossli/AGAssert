AGAssert
========

Similar to NSAssert, but with slightly improved logging and is meant to ship with apps in release.

Benefits of using this over NSAssert:

- It is default **on** in all configurations since it uses `AG_BLOCK_ASSERTIONS` and not `NS_BLOCK_ASSERTIONS`.
- Slightly improved logging.
- Fewer macros and less mess.
- Does not require any description string as second parameter

The assert will raise an exception.
